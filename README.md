## üß† Overview

This study aimed to assess how walking kinetics and CoM vertical displacement changes in response to added mass in non-pregnant women.

This is a biomechanics research project that I volunteered with Dr. Zhang-Lea from Gonzaga University/University of Oregon from January 2024 to April 2025. I submitted and presented an abstract in the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Northwest 2025 conference.
